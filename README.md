# ABOUT

This website requires a **very old** version of node. Newer versions might work,
but they have not been tested.

See the INSTALL file for prerequisites/setup.

Running "node server.js" will start up servers at http://localhost:7080
and http://localhost:7443. The former is the regular http server, and
the latter is the ssl-equivalent server, which, for testing purposes,
does not actually run over an ssl connection (also for purposes of being
behind a proxy that handles the ssl connection in production).

Everything is in an pre-alpha state, so don't be surprised if anything breaks.

# LICENSE

For now, this project is not licensed for any use besides that of the author. 
This will likely change, but it is what it is for now.

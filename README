See the INSTALL file for prerequisites/setup.

You will probably want to edit lib/base/index.js to set proper values
for the config variable.

Running "node server.js" will start up servers at http://localhost:7080
and http://localhost:7443. The former is the regular http server, and
the latter is the ssl-equivalent server, which, for testing purposes,
does not actually run over an ssl connection (also for purposes of being
behind a proxy that handles the ssl connection in production).

Everything is in an alpha state, so don't be surprised if anything breaks.
